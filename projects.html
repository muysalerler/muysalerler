      <h3>Path Blocker</h3>
      <p>Path Blocker is a simple strategy puzzle game where the goal is to block the path of an AI-controlled player or object trying to reach a destination. The player places obstacles or walls on a grid-based map in an attempt to stop or delay the opponent's movement.

        The challenge lies in predicting the AI's pathfinding logic and placing blockers efficiently to either trap the target or slow it down as much as possible. The game may use algorithms like A* or Dijkstra for pathfinding, making it a test of both planning and timing.
        
        It's a great exercise in logic, AI interaction, and grid-based movement systems.</p>

      <h3>Farming Management Game (C++)</h3>
      <p>Farming Management Game is a console-based simulation game developed in C++ that allows players to manage a virtual farm. The player can plant and harvest crops, monitor the farm's status, and handle random events such as weather changes or pest attacks.

        The game focuses on applying object-oriented programming principles such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation. Each part of the farm (fields, crops, tools) is modeled as an object, and the system includes a simple event manager to simulate in-game dynamics.
        
        This project demonstrates skills in system design, logic implementation, and interactive console interfaces.</p>
